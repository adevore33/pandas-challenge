Between the two data CSVs, we have a total of 15 schools containing 39,170 students.  The budget of all these schools is $24,649,428.00.  The average math scores are 78.99, a "C+" letter grade, and the average reading score is 81.88, a "B-" letter grade.  The percentage of students passing math (score higher than 70) is 74.98 whereas reading as a passing percentage of 85.81.  The overall percent of students passing both is 65.17.
One observation I made is the passing rates against the size of the school.  I went to a small Division 3 school where I enjoyed the smaller, more intiment class size.  With a class with under 2000 students the passing scores for reading and math we substantually better than schools with students between 2000-5000.  
Another observation was that budget looked to really play no correlation in passing rate of the students.  With Bailey, Hernandez, and Johnson high school having the top 3 overall budgets, they were in the mid/bottom of the list of overall passing rates.  Along with the Capita they seemed to be kind of all over the place in their ranks of overall passing rates.
A couple of things I did wonder about the schools were some enviorment factors of the location of the schools such as are they inter-city, suburban or rural schools.  Also, the amount of teachers each school had and what the student/teacher ratio would be.
